# Game Name

**Team Members:** keventhen4, Tempura, Magg166, Pencil

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
> A simple game about trust and rhythm... and cats.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
> Different layers of music being added and changed with different interactions, creating a "juicy" mood that brings everything in, a dynamic symphony that shows how important the language of music is (it's still dialogue-less, and is a game mechanic muehehehe). Game theory ties into the battle system, as it is still a game of trusts after all. Who's gonna do what, who can you trust, and how will your actions and the actions of others change the environment and the mood?

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
> Players will encounter and defeat enemies through a game theory based combat system which will reward them with materials, tools connections, and hopefully new insights and perspectives about trust

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
> Players will also explore while trying to perfect the masterpiece their interactions make, allowing for creativity. Additionally, the combat system will provide suspense. Do you trust them, or do you not? Will they trust you? Or perhaps, do you have some strategy?
